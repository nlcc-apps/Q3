This innovative system replaces the old manual process with a seamless, automated link that makes communication between departments faster, smarter, and more reliable.\n\nWith e-Memo, every purchase request and invoice is automatically logged and tracked from creation to approval.

    "A1": "The Carepath system has been a key part of ensuring smooth clinical and treatment workflows on Aria. However, we‚Äôve observed that some activities continue outside of Carepath, as the system currently allows users to proceed without enforcing its use. This may seem convenient, but it has important implications for care quality and tracking.\n\nWhen Carepath is bypassed, the system can‚Äôt accurately track pending contouring, ready plans, or task completions. Users also miss out on automatic notifications and reminders, leaving some activities open or unmonitored ‚Äî which can affect both efficiency and patient safety.\n\nOur IT and clinical teams are actively working to close these gaps. Soon, when a major activity is opened outside Carepath, the system will prompt a friendly reminder ‚Äî ‚ÄúHey there, this isn‚Äôt possible. Please go through Carepath to proceed.‚Äù",
